1,Cardiovascular,Apply,"While performing a cardiovascular exam, which technique best helps detect a left ventricular heave?",Palpating with the heel of the hand at the left sternal border,Percussing along the midclavicular line,Auscultating with the diaphragm at the apex,Inspecting the precordium from the foot of the bed,A,Hand placement and pressure are key to appreciating subtle lifts.,Percussion is not the primary method for assessing ventricular movement.,Auscultation assesses sounds rather than chest wall motion.,Inspection alone may miss subtle precordial movement.,
2,Cardiovascular,Analyze,A patient’s apical impulse is palpated lateral to the midclavicular line in the fifth intercostal space. This finding is most appropriately interpreted as:,A normal variation based on body habitus,A potential indicator of ventricular enlargement,Expected with aging across all adults,Associated primarily with valvular stenosis,B,Normal variation has limits in location.,Impulse displacement reflects underlying cardiac mechanics.,Age alone does not typically shift the apical impulse.,Valvular disease does not consistently alter impulse location.,
3,Respiratory,Apply,Which maneuver is most appropriate to assess symmetric chest expansion?,Placing thumbs at the level of T9–T10 posteriorly and asking the patient to inhale,Percussing anterior lung fields during quiet breathing,Auscultating while the patient speaks in a whisper,Observing respiratory rate while seated,A,This positioning emphasizes posterior thoracic movement.,"Percussion evaluates resonance, not expansion.",Whispered sounds assess sound transmission.,Rate observation does not assess symmetry.,
4,Respiratory,Understand,Bronchovesicular breath sounds are normally heard over which area in healthy adults?,Peripheral lung fields,Major bronchi between the scapulae,Over the trachea,At the lung bases posteriorly,B,Peripheral fields typically transmit softer sounds.,Sound intensity reflects airway size and location.,Tracheal sounds are harsher and louder.,Bases usually transmit vesicular sounds.,
5,Musculoskeletal,Apply,"When assessing shoulder abduction strength, which instruction best isolates the deltoid muscle?",Ask the patient to abduct the arm against resistance at 90 degrees,Have the patient internally rotate the shoulder against resistance,Instruct the patient to shrug the shoulders upward,Ask the patient to flex the elbow while abducting the arm,A,Resistance at this angle emphasizes deltoid contribution.,Internal rotation tests different muscle groups.,Shrugging primarily evaluates trapezius function.,Elbow flexion recruits additional muscles.,
6,Musculoskeletal,Analyze,Pain reproduced during the Phalen maneuver most directly suggests involvement of which structure?,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,Radial artery,Flexor digitorum tendon,A,This maneuver increases pressure within the carpal tunnel.,Ulnar nerve compression presents differently.,Vascular structures are not stressed in this position.,Tendons are not the primary focus of this test.,
7,Neurologic,Apply,Which technique best assesses cerebellar function in an adult patient?,Rapid alternating movements of the hands,Testing light touch sensation on the forearms,Assessing pupillary light response,Evaluating muscle tone at rest,A,Coordination tasks stress cerebellar pathways.,Sensation testing evaluates peripheral pathways.,Pupillary response reflects cranial nerve function.,Tone assessment focuses on motor pathways.,
8,Neurologic,Analyze,"During cranial nerve assessment, difficulty with tongue protrusion most directly involves which nerve?",Cranial nerve V,Cranial nerve VII,Cranial nerve IX,Cranial nerve XII,D,Mastication involves a different nerve.,Facial expression uses separate pathways.,Swallowing involves multiple structures.,Tongue movement depends on hypoglossal function.,
9,Abdominal,Apply,Which sequence represents the correct order of abdominal examination?,"Inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation","Inspection, percussion, palpation, auscultation","Auscultation, inspection, palpation, percussion","Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation",A,This order minimizes alteration of bowel sounds.,Percussion before auscultation may change findings.,Inspection should precede other techniques.,Auscultation is not performed last.,
10,Abdominal,Analyze,A tympanic sound predominates during percussion of the abdomen. This finding is generally associated with:,Underlying solid organ enlargement,The presence of gas within the intestines,Significant fluid accumulation,Increased abdominal wall thickness,B,Solid organs typically produce dullness.,Gas alters sound transmission.,Fluid shifts percussion tones.,Wall thickness affects palpation more than percussion.,
11,HEENT,Apply,"When inspecting the tympanic membrane, which feature most strongly suggests a normal finding?",A pearly gray color with visible landmarks,Diffuse erythema with absent landmarks,"A bulging, opaque surface",A retracted membrane with air-fluid levels,A,Normal membranes have consistent color and anatomy.,Redness often reflects inflammation.,Bulging suggests pressure changes.,Fluid levels indicate middle ear involvement.,
12,HEENT,Understand,Which structure is best assessed by asking a patient to say 'ah' during the oral exam?,Soft palate elevation,Tongue strength,Teeth alignment,Salivary gland output,A,Palatal movement reflects neuromuscular integrity.,Tongue strength requires resistance testing.,Dental alignment is assessed visually.,Salivation is not evaluated with this task.,
13,Integumentary,Analyze,Which characteristic of a skin lesion is most important to document when assessing for potential malignancy?,Distribution across the body,Overall skin dryness,Border regularity,Associated hair growth,C,Distribution alone is nonspecific.,Dryness is a generalized skin finding.,Borders provide key clues to lesion behavior.,Hair growth is less diagnostically significant.,
14,Integumentary,Apply,Palpation of skin temperature is best performed using which part of the examiner’s hand?,Dorsal surface of the hand,Fingertips,Palm of the hand,Thenar eminence,A,This surface is more sensitive to temperature differences.,Fingertips are better for texture and shape.,Palms are less temperature sensitive.,Thenar area is not optimal for this purpose.,
15,Communication,Apply,Which opening question best facilitates a patient-centered health interview?,What concerns would you like to address today?,Are you having pain right now?,Did you take your medications today?,"You’re here for a routine visit, correct?",A,Open-ended prompts encourage patient priorities.,Closed questions limit initial information.,Medication questions are more appropriate later.,This phrasing narrows the agenda prematurely.,
16,Communication,Analyze,"During an interview, a patient provides vague responses. Which strategy is most appropriate?",Use focused follow-up questions to clarify,Redirect the conversation to the next system,Provide reassurance and move on,Repeat the same question verbatim,A,Clarification improves accuracy of collected data.,Abrupt transitions may miss key information.,Reassurance alone does not clarify meaning.,Repetition without rephrasing is often ineffective.,
17,Pediatrics,Apply,"When assessing a toddler, which approach best supports accurate findings?",Separate the child from the caregiver immediately,Begin with invasive components first,Observe the child before initiating hands-on exam,Rely primarily on verbal responses,C,Caregiver presence often improves cooperation.,Early invasive steps may increase distress.,Observation provides baseline behavior and comfort.,Verbal responses are developmentally limited.,
18,Geriatrics,Analyze,Which age-related change should be considered normal during a geriatric respiratory assessment?,Decreased chest wall compliance,Absent breath sounds bilaterally,Persistent inspiratory crackles,Marked asymmetry in chest expansion,A,Structural changes affect ventilation mechanics.,Absent sounds are not expected.,Crackles suggest pathology.,Asymmetry warrants further evaluation.,
19,Vital Signs,Apply,Which technique best ensures accurate blood pressure measurement in adults?,Positioning the arm below heart level,Placing the cuff loosely to improve comfort,Measuring immediately after physical activity,Using a cuff with bladder width approximately 40% of arm circumference,D,Arm position influences pressure values.,Loose cuffs distort readings.,Activity elevates blood pressure transiently.,Cuff size directly affects measurement accuracy.,
20,General Assessment,Analyze,"During a general survey, which observation provides the most immediate insight into overall health status?",Level of alertness and orientation,Exact body weight,Reported dietary intake,Past medical history list,A,Mental status reflects multiple physiologic systems.,Weight is important but less immediate.,Dietary history requires further context.,History review occurs after initial observation.,
