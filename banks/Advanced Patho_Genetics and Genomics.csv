Q1,Teratogens,Analysis,A 27-year-old patient who recently discovered they are pregnant reports using an acne medication prescribed months ago. The patient recalls the label warning about pregnancy. Which factor most determines the potential for fetal harm from this exposure?,The drug’s teratogenic classification and timing of exposure,The drug’s classification and timing determine risk because teratogens act during organ formation.,Whether the medication was over-the-counter or prescription,OTC vs. prescription doesn’t predict fetal risk.,The dose taken on a single occasion,A single dose matters less than timing during development.,The mother’s age and parity,Maternal age and parity don’t affect teratogenic potential.,A,
Q2,Epigenetics,Analysis,A nurse practitioner explains that environmental factors can alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. Which statement best reflects this concept?,Mutations directly change gene activity regulation,"Mutations change DNA itself, not gene activity regulation.",Epigenetic changes modify gene activity without altering DNA sequence,Epigenetic changes alter gene activity without changing DNA sequence.,Inherited traits only pass through changes in base order,Inheritance of traits involves more than base order changes.,Chromosomal deletions are responsible for all gene expression changes,Deletions remove genes; they don’t regulate expression.,B,
Q3,DNA Structure,Application,A patient undergoing genetic testing asks what DNA is made of. Which explanation best describes the molecule’s composition?,Four chemical bases,DNA contains four bases forming the double helix.,Triple helix,Triple helix is incorrect; DNA has two strands.,Phosphate and calcium molecules,"DNA contains phosphate and sugar, not calcium.",Circular helix,"Human DNA is linear, not circular.",A,
Q4,Modes of Inheritance,Application,A couple reports that several family members have an inherited condition that skips generations and affects both males and females equally. Which mode of inheritance does this pattern most likely represent?,X-linked dominant,X-linked dominant traits don’t skip generations.,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal recessive traits appear when both alleles are abnormal.,X-linked autosomal,“X-linked autosomal” is not a valid inheritance type.,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal dominant traits usually appear in every generation.,B,
Q5,Teratogenic Exposure,Application,A pregnant patient working in a lab is exposed to a chemical agent. The nurse practitioner explains that fetal risk depends on which combination of factors?,"Timing, agent, and dose of exposure","Teratogenic risk depends on agent, dose, and timing of exposure.",Duration of maternal employment,Employment length isn’t relevant unless exposure is ongoing.,Placental blood flow and diet,"Placental flow affects growth, not direct teratogenicity.",Genetic testing results,Genetics don’t determine exposure risk.,A,
Q6,Genetic Variation,Application,Two siblings show different phenotypes for the same gene. Which mechanism best explains this variation?,Differences in the order of DNA bases,Sequence differences in DNA bases create genetic diversity.,Chromosomal nondisjunction,"Nondisjunction affects chromosome number, not gene variation.",Incomplete dominance,"Incomplete dominance explains expression, not origin.",Environmental epigenetic changes,"Epigenetics modifies expression, not base sequence.",A,
Q7,Gene to Protein Pathway,Analysis,A biopsy shows a mutation that prevents mRNA translation. Which step in protein synthesis is directly disrupted?,Coding sequence transcription,Transcription makes mRNA but isn’t affected here.,Translation of mRNA into protein,Translation converts mRNA into proteins; disruption halts synthesis.,Replication of DNA strands,"Replication copies DNA, not protein synthesis.",Post-translational protein folding,"Folding occurs after translation, not before.",B,
Q8,Genomic Disorders,Application,Genetic analysis of a child with multiple congenital anomalies reveals loss of a chromosome segment. This finding represents which type of genetic syndrome?,Transformation,"Transformation occurs in bacteria, not humans.",Replication,"Replication is normal cell division, not a disorder.",Deletion,Deletion syndromes involve loss of a chromosome segment.,Duplication,"Duplication adds extra material, not losses.",C,
Q9,Genotype Determination,Application,A nurse practitioner explains that a child’s genotype results from the combination of parental genes. Which statement correctly describes this process?,Both alleles come from the mother,Both alleles can’t come from one parent.,Alleles are determined randomly after conception,"Alleles combine at conception, not randomly later.",One allele comes from each parent,Each parent contributes one allele for every gene.,Alleles change during development,Alleles stay fixed; only expression changes.,C,
Q10,Congenital Anomalies,Analysis,An infant is born with multiple structural defects. Which cause would the nurse practitioner rule out as genetic in origin?,Mitochondrial gene disorder,Mitochondrial mutations are genetic.,Single gene disorder,Single-gene disorders are genetic.,Chromosomal disorder,Chromosomal changes are genetic.,Single factorial disorder,“Single factorial” isn’t a recognized genetic mechanism.,D,
